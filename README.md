# NumberRangeSummarizer
Implements code which has the ability to produce a comma delimited list of numbers, grouping the numbers into a range when they are sequential.
The program was creating using GNU/Linux command-line.

Ensure you have jdk, jre and at least Java 8 running.

Compile using :      javac  NumberRangeSummarizer    //compile the interface 
                     javac Summarizer.java          // implement the interface
                     javac Main.java               //For manual testing


    Run           :   java Main 


Alternatively, the Main class can be used to take input from a .txt file and parse it into Summarizer
